**Answer (STAR Format):**

**Situation**
As a data analyst working in the payment area, I frequently had to present insights from complex transaction data to non-technical business stakeholders and senior leadership.

**Task**
One instance that stands out was when I had to explain the root causes behind a significant spike in chargebacks to cross-functional teams who didn't have a technical background. The spike was caused by one of our partners changing their yearly membership fees, which resulted in numerous chargebacks. After identifying the root cause, I needed to effectively communicate the situation to the compliance and customer service teams and collaborate with them to develop a solution.

**Action**
To ensure they understood the complexities involved, I started by providing a high-level overview of the chargeback process and its impact on our business, using simple analogies and real-world examples to explain key concepts. I focused on telling a story through visually appealing charts and graphs by Tableau that highlighted critical trends and patterns related to the membership fee change. I incorporated interactive elements, allowing them to explore the data and filter by specific partners or regions. This interactive visualization helped them grasp the nuances and develop a deeper understanding of the issue.

**Result** 
My approach resonated well with the audience, as evidenced by their active engagement and insightful follow-up questions. This session helped cross-functional teams to implement targeted strategies that successfully mitigated the chargeback issue. This experience showed my ability to communicate complex data effectively to non-technical stakeholders, facilitating cross-team collaboration and driving tangible business impact.
