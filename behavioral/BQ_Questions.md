## Question 1:  
Tell us about a time when you had to explain complex data to a non-technical audience. How did you ensure they understood?
- This assesses your communication skills and your ability to make data accessible to everyone.

**Answer:**

**Situation**
As a data analyst working in the payment area, I frequently had to present insights from complex transaction data to non-technical business stakeholders and senior leadership.

**Task**
One instance that stands out was when I had to explain the root causes behind a significant spike in chargebacks to cross-functional teams who didn't have a technical background. The spike was caused by one of our partners changing their yearly membership fees, which resulted in numerous chargebacks. After identifying the root cause, I needed to effectively communicate the situation to the compliance and customer service teams and collaborate with them to develop a solution.

**Action**
To ensure they understood the complexities involved, I started by providing a high-level overview of the chargeback process and its impact on our business, using simple analogies and real-world examples to explain key concepts. I focused on telling a story through visually appealing charts and graphs by Tableau that highlighted critical trends and patterns related to the membership fee change. I incorporated interactive elements, allowing them to explore the data and filter by specific partners or regions. This interactive visualization helped them grasp the nuances and develop a deeper understanding of the issue.

**Result** 
My approach resonated well with the audience, as evidenced by their active engagement and insightful follow-up questions. This session helped cross-functional teams to implement targeted strategies that successfully mitigated the chargeback issue. This experience showed my ability to communicate complex data effectively to non-technical stakeholders, facilitating cross-team collaboration and driving tangible business impact.

## Question 2: 
Describe a situation where you had to work with a difficult team member or stakeholder. How did you handle it?
- This question probes into your teamwork and conflict resolution skills.

**Answer:**

**Situation:** 
During a project to migrate our reporting and alerting system from Splunk to Tableau, I encountered resistance from a lead on the customer service team who was reluctant to adopt the new Tableau dashboards and reporting workflows.

**Task:** 
My task was to address the concerns of this stakeholder and ensure a smooth transition for the customer service team, minimizing disruptions to their daily operations and reporting needs.
 
**Action:** 
To handle this situation, I scheduled a dedicated meeting with the customer service team lead to understand their specific concerns and reservations about the migration to Tableau. I listened patiently and acknowledged their challenges with the proposed change, ensuring they felt heard and respected.

I then took a hands-on approach, offering personalized training sessions and walkthroughs of the new Tableau dashboards and reporting capabilities. I highlighted the key advantages, such as improved visualization options and interactive filtering, and demonstrated how these features could streamline their workflows.

During these sessions, I encouraged open dialogue and addressed their questions and concerns directly, providing concrete examples and use cases tailored to their specific needs. I also involved power users from the team to get their feedback and incorporated their suggestions into the dashboard designs.

Additionally, I proposed a phased rollout approach, where we would run Splunk and Tableau in parallel for a transitional period, allowing the team to familiarize themselves with the new system gradually, while still having access to their existing Splunk dashboards.

**Result:** Through active listening, personalized training, and a collaborative approach, I was able to overcome the initial resistance from the customer service team lead. By addressing their concerns head-on and involving them in the decision-making process, we were able to build trust and buy-in for the migration to Tableau.

The phased rollout approach ensured a smooth transition, minimizing disruptions to their daily operations, and allowed the team to fully embrace the new reporting capabilities. The customer service team ultimately became advocates for the Tableau dashboards, praising their improved functionality and user experience.
